# `config/` Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the project.

## Structure

- `env/`: Environment-specific configurations (e.g., `development`, `production`).
- `database.js`: Database connection settings.
- `apiConfig.js`: API keys and endpoints.

## Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive information like API keys directly to the repository. Use environment variables instead.
- Make sure to update configurations for new environments or settings.
