## Gradle Template with Dokka and JSON Configuration

This repository provides a **Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle Template** designed to streamline the setup of new projects. It includes pre-configured **Dokka** documentation generation and dynamic **JSON-based app settings** for flexible configuration. The goal of this template is to help developers kickstart their projects with a clean, scalable, and reusable Gradle setup that supports documentation and configuration management from the start.

### Key Features:
- **Kotlin Multiplatform Setup**: A ready-to-use structure with multi-project support, making it easy to add and manage new components (e.g., API, services).
- **Dokka Integration**: Automated generation of documentation using **Dokka**, with customizable output directories and formats.
- **JSON Configuration**: Easily configure project settings like the app name, version, and documentation output directory via a JSON file (`app-settings.json`).
- **Modular and Scalable**: The project is designed to grow as your application scales, allowing for the addition of new modules and services without complex setup.

### Project Structure:
- **product/**: Contains the main subprojects (e.g., API, service).
- **config/**: Houses the `app-settings.json` file for easy configuration.
- **docs/**: Outputs documentation generated by Dokka.
- **build-logic/** (optional): A space to add reusable Gradle plugins to automate common tasks.

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradle-template.git
   cd gradle-template
   ```

2. **Configure the project**:
    - Modify the `app-settings.json` file in the `config/` directory to fit your project needs (e.g., app name, version, documentation output directory).

3. **Generate Documentation**:
    - Run the following command to generate documentation using Dokka:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew dokkaHtml
   ```

4. **Extend the Template**:
    - Add new subprojects (e.g., new services, APIs) in the `product/` directory and configure them in the `settings.gradle.kts` file.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Custom Gradle Plugin**: Automate project configuration and setup using a custom Gradle plugin.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up **GitHub Actions** or similar CI/CD tools for continuous documentation generation and project builds.
