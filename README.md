## Getting Started

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Other dependencies if applicable

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```
   
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash

    ```

3. Start the development server:

## Branching Strategy

This repository follows the **GitFlow** branching model:

- **main**: Stable production code.
- **develop**: Integration of features before merging to main.
- **feature/xxx**: New features or bug fixes, created from develop and merged back after completion.
- **release/xxx**: Release preparation branches.
- **hotfix/xxx**: Quick fixes to the main branch.

### Example Flow:

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. After completing work, push the feature and create a pull request to merge back into `develop`.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for consistency:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user login functionality"
```
