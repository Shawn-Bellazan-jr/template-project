# `src/` Directory

This directory contains the source code for the project. Typically, in a Kotlin DSL Gradle project, this includes application code and resources.

## Structure

- `main/kotlin/`: Contains the Kotlin source files.
- `main/resources/`: Contains resources like properties, configuration files, etc.
- `test/kotlin/`: Contains test code for unit and integration tests.

## Guidelines

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions and ensure proper documentation for all classes and functions.
- Organize code into modules/packages for clarity and reusability.
- Add tests for each new feature or bug fix in the corresponding `test/kotlin/` directory.
